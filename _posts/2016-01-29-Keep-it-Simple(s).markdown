##*K.I.S.S - Keep It Simple(s)!*


Hello and thank you for reading our very first blog post! We thought the best way to start off our blog is give a bit of a background on one of our key fundamental design beliefs which is keeping things simple. Well we say simple with an (s) because not only is there a limit to how simple something can be but also how many things can you simplify -In the spirit of simplicity we will try to keep this post as simple as simple simon says it can be simple!
